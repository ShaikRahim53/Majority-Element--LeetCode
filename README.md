# Majority-Element--LeetCode
Majority Element - LeetCode (Day - 3 of #100daysCodingChallenge - DSA)
Solved this problem in brute force approach, at first tried with map data structure, but end up with brute force to maintain streak in leetcode. After getting into solutions section, i found the solution with a algorithm called "Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm". I can't understand it, but to look into this algorithm. Later getting into YT for solution/approach, realized this question was asked in Facebook although it is categorized into Easy problem in LC. I will update here when i solve it optimal approach.
